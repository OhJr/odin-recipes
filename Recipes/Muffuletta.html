            <h3>A genuine muffuletta should be made on oven-fresh round Italian bread loves topped with sesame seeds.<br>
                The spicy, tangy olive salad is what really sets this meat and cheese sandwich apart.<br> These gigantic sandwiches were invented a century ago at Sicilian Deli here in New Orleans.<br>
                Be sure to use high-quality ingredients as it really makes a difference!</h3>

        <strong><p>Sandwiches:<p></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (1 pound) loaves Italian bread</li>
            <li>8 ounces thinly sliced Genoa salami</li>
            <li>8 ounces thinly sliced cooked ham</li>
            <li>8 ounces sliced mortadella</li>

        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <ol>
            <p><strong>To make the olive salad:</strong></p>
            <li>Roughly chop together green olives, Kalamata olives, pepperoncini, cauliflower, cocktail onions, garlic, capers, celery, and carrot.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Combine with oregano, basil, black pepper, and celery seed in a medium bowl. Add in olive oil, canola oil, and vinegar. Mix together and transfer the mixture into a glass jar (or other nonreactive container). Pour in more oil to cover if needed.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cover the jar or container and refrigerate at least 8 hours overnight</li>
            <p><strong>To make the sandwiches:</strong></p>
            <li>Cut loaves of bread in half horizontally; hollow out some of the excess bread to make room for filling.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Spread each piece of bread with equal amounts of the olive salad, including oil.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Layer bottom half of each loaf with 1/2 of the salami, ham, mortadella, mozzarella, and Provolone slices.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Replace top half on each loaf and cut the sandwiches into quarters.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Serve immediately, or wrap tightly and refrigerate for a few hours; this will allow for the flavors to mingle and the olive salad to soak into the bread.</li>
        </ol>
