        <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cake pan with butter and lightly dust with flour.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Slice the strawberries and toss them with 1/3 cup of white sugar. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Combine flour, 1/4 cup of white sugar, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl;<br>
                    cut in butter with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Make a well in the center of mixture;<br>
                    add beaten egg, half-and-half, and 1 teaspoon vanilla.  Stir mixture until just combined and no dry spots remain, being careful not to overmix.</li>
                <li>Spoon batter evenly into prepared cake pan.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean and top is golden brown, about 18 minutes.<br>
                    Let cool partially in cake pan, about 10 minutes. Flip cake onto a clean work surface.</li>\
                <br>
                <li>Meanwhile, beat heavy cream, powdered sugar, and remaining 1 teaspoon vanilla with an electric mixer on medium-high speed<br>
                    until soft peaks form, about 3 minutes. Set aside.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Cut partially cooled cake in half horizontally, making 2 layers; set top layer aside. Drain reserved strawberries in a colander<br>
                    placed over a small bowl, reserving any juice. Brush strawberry juice evenly over top of bottom cake layer. Evenly arrange ½ of the drained<br>
                    strawberries over bottom layer of cake.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Spread ½ of whipped cream evenly over strawberries; place top cake layer over whipped cream. Top with remaining strawberries and whipped cream.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
